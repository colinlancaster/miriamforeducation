        <p class="feature-box__text">
            Having the option for parents and the Board to come up with a compromise in which families can have the least impact with their families; requesting transfer and assuring the class size for each grade level is appropriate for learning.

        <h3 class="heading-tertiary u-margin-bottom-small"><i class="fas fa-check">&nbsp;</i>Real World Classes</h3>
        <p class="feature-box__text">
          Miriam believes that there should be classes that emphasize the everyday real-world situations we all face. For example: how to do your taxes, how to balance a home budget, about rent/mortgages, etc.  All of these are things missing from public education and are causing a huge gap in the capabilities of students to make themselves independent upon graduation.

            Miriam believes that all students have different needs. Some thrive in college to seek their careers while vocational education is a fantastic alternative for others. Both are needed to create a diverse community with different skills and to ensure a strong, stable economy for Albany.
