          Miriam believes that there should be classes that emphasize the everyday real-world situations we all face.  For example: how to do your taxes, how to balance a home budget, about rent/mortgages, etc.  All of these are things missing from public education and are causing a huge gap in the capabilities of students to make themselves independent upon graduation.
