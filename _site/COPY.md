A Passion for Education

Miriam Cummins, a mother of a Daughter in public school, and a Son who receives special education services from LBL ESD, is a proud advocate for Latino families and equitable education.  As an immigrant herself, Miriam understands the needs for minority representation, and cultural inclusiveness in schools.  Miriam believes that there is a lack of understanding and accountability in the school system and has always worked to allow families to get what they deserve.  This passion for advocacy has driven Miriam her whole life, and now drives her to seeking the positions of both the Greater Albany Public School Board and the Linn Benton Lincoln ESD Board.



Miriam was born in Zamora, Michoacan, Mexcio.  She immigrated to the United States in 1996 where she first learned English at elementary school in Coos Bay, Oregon.  While working to help her father start his own business as a General Contractor, Miriam graduated from Marshfield High School with Honors.  Miriam was awarded a scholarship through the Ford Family Foundation as a Ford Scholar and attended Western Oregon University.  Before transferring to Oregon State University, Miriam studied abroad in Spain, then took another opportunity to study abroad in France after her first year at OSU.  In 2009 Miriam married her college sweetheart Basil Cummins.  In 2011 Miriam Graduated from Oregon State University with a Bachelor of Arts in Spanish and a Minor in French.  After college Miriam worked in the Financial Aid Office at OSU where she thoroughly enjoyed helping students find opportunities to pay for their studies.  Two years later after her Daughter was born, Miriam took a job in Albany as an Interpreter/Translator for Linn Benton Lincoln ESD.  At this job Miriam interacted with wide range of families that were seeking help and didn’t know about the services available to them.  After seeing a need for minority representation and the beginnings of her family growing (with the birth of her Son), Miriam obtained her US Citizenship in 2016.  Because of her position at LBL, Miriam felt that she couldn’t fully advocate for the families she met.  This eventually led Miriam to take her current position at Salem-Keizer Coalition for Equality as a Resource Development and Executive Assistant in 2018.

With her children beginning in the public education system, and through all the struggles she dealt with personally in education, Miriam has decided that he wants to work to change the following things in the school system:

Accountability.  Miriam believes that there is a lack of accountability in the school districts.  She believes that it is just as important to encourage good teachers to stay as well as to train and coach struggling teachers.

Improve Albany’s Education Performance.  Miriam believes that he States report on Education Performance shows that Albany has a lot of room to improve to be one of the best in the state.

Cultural Awareness.  Miriam would like to see more cultural awareness training for teachers and staff.  Many times, as an interpreter/translator, Miriam felt minority families were not given the respect/care they deserved.

Real World Classes.  Miriam believes that there should be classes that emphasize the everyday real-world situations we all face.  For example: how to do your taxes, how to balance a home budget, about rent/mortgages, etc.  All of these are things missing from public education and are causing a huge gap in the capabilities of students to make themselves independent upon graduation.

More Educational Options.  Miriam believes that all students have different needs.  Some thrive in college to seek their careers while vocational education is a fantastic alternative for others.  Both are needed to create a diverse community with different skills and to ensure a strong, stable economy for Albany.

Miriam’s experience in higher education as well as in K-12 public systems, and her knowledge in special education (both as an advocate and a parent), will make her a strong advocate for working families.  Miriam has always been open to listen to the needs of parents and is very compassionate and understanding.  These are the skills that she will bring to the Boards and make her the right choice.

As a parent your voice needs to be heard.  Please vote for Miriam to make sure your voice is heard.
